# Output

By default, Henri's doesn't export a thing. It's just a package with a toolset you can use in your project. 

Do you want to use the premade style? Grid? etc? You have to define the output of henri's in your main file. 

## Default output

If you want to use the default output settings, just tell henri's you want to get the css: 
```scss
@include output-setting('css',true');
```
See [installation](/installation) for more information.
